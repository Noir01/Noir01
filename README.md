# Hi, I'm Aniruddh ðŸ‘‹

I'm a junior at [Purdue](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/), with an interest in writing low-level software and programming languages.

Currently, I'm working as a student researcher on the [Gibbon](https://github.com/iu-parfunc/gibbon) project at Purdue, where I get to explore exciting challenges related to compilers, memory management, and performance optimization.

I'm always eager to learn, build cool things, and collaborate on interesting projectsâ€”especially those involving systems programming and compiler development.

Feel free to reach out or connect!
